# C++ Data Structures
Demonstrated knowledge of the following concepts via building small programs surrounding such topics

Basics of Compilers in relationship to C++ compilation to object and machine code via makefile scripting.
Basics of Algorithmic Design - Essentially how to design a sequence of precise instructions that leads to a solution.

The similar-sounding word algebra was derived from the Arabic word al-jabr, which appears in the title of the book and which is often translated as reuniting or restoring. The meanings of the words algebra and algorithm used to be much more intimately related than they are today. Indeed, until modern times, the word algorithm usually referred only to algebraic rules for solving numerical equations. Today, the word algorithm can be applied to a wide variety of kinds of instructions for manipulating symbolic as well as numeric data.
