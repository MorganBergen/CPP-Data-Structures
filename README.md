# C++ Data Structures
Demonstrated knowledge of the following concepts via building small programs surrounding such topics

Basics of Compilers in relationship to C++ compilation to object and machine code via makefile scripting.
Basics of Algorithmic Design - Essentially how to design a sequence of precise instructions that leads to a solution.
Principles of object-oriented programming design
1. Encapsulation: Objects combine data and operations.
2. Inheritance: Classes can inherit properties from other classes.
3. Polymorphism: Objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time.=
