# C++ Data Structures

## Description 

Demonstrated knowledge of the following concepts via building small programs surrounding such topics.  Basics of Compilers in relationship to C++ compilation to object and machine code via makefile scripting.  Basics of Algorithmic Design - Essentially how to design a sequence of precise instructions that leads to a solution.

General principles of object-oriented programming design

1. Encapsulation: Objects combine data and operations.
2. Inheritance: Classes can inherit properties from other classes.
3. Polymorphism: Objects can determine appropriate operations at execution time.

###  Exception Handling Basics

-  Throw Statement
-  Catch Block
-  Try Block
-  Catching Multiple Exceptions Throwing an Exception in a Function Exception Specification
-  Exception Specification in Derived Classes When to throw an Exception
-  Nested try-catch blocks
-  Exception Class Hierarchies
-  Testing for Available Memory Re-throwing an Exception `std::runtime_error`
